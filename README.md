# Sean Swanson's Portfolio

## Welcome to my portfolio's repository!

Here, you'll find the source code for my latest personal website, which showcases my web development and art projects, as well as my blog posts. You can also download my CV from the website.

## Tech Stack

I built the website using Next.js, a popular React framework. I also used TypeScript for static type checking and Tailwind for styling.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Next.js file structure:

- pages/: Contains all the page components. Each file corresponds to a route on the website.
- components/: Contains reusable React components.
- public/: Contains static files like images and the downloadable CV.
- data/: Contains JSON data for the CV and project details.
  Running the Project Locally

To run the project on your local machine, use the following commands:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

Then, open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

I chose to use Vercel, a platform from the creators of Next.js, for deployment. The set up is painless and the app management is even easier.
