There is just something about album art that leaves me wishing it was more than just a static image. So I gave this one the 3D treatment to bring it to life!\n\nüñºThe original album art depicted a tear with a collage by Gideon London revealed underneath. To translate this into 3D meant extracting each layer painstakingly with Photoshop. With each layer now a separate piece in a stack, the pieces will look subtly different/askew depending on the camera perspective because of the variation in distance away from the lens.\n\nAdd some ‚Äúdust‚Äù particles, a bit of movement, and a textured background that dynamically responds to light and üí• BOOM ~ art ~\n\nHow does your music inspire you? Stay well, lovely people of the internet.",

    description:
      "This project is my 3D take on the album art from Zero 7's \"When It Falls\". The scene really comes together at Frame 50, where the original art lines up perfectly with my work. I used different tricks like converting the artwork into SVG and then turning those into 3D meshes to make this happen. \n\nTo give it a little extra something, I added some compositing effects like chromatic aberration and film grain. The original artwork is a piece from Blue Source Studios, but not much is known about them. With this piece, I've tried to keep the spirit of the original while putting my own spin on it. It's art meets music, in 3D.",
