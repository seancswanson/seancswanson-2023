      "This is my 3D extension of renowned Japanese illustrator/graphic designer Hiroshi Nagai's 'Southern Freeway' (2017).\n I was drawn to Nagai's use of vibrant colors and the dreamy Americana in his subject matter.\n While most of my pieces are original, this one is a heavily influenced remix from the original. This was the first time I tried to match the original composition 1-to-1 and then remix the elements from there. An interesting fact about this piece is that the bush with red flowers on the left side of the image was generated by DALL-E 2, a new AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language.\n\n I started this piece at the beginning of 2021, only a few months after figuring my way around Blender. Back then, I was constantly jumping from project to project to apply new techniques and imagine new concepts. This project fell off my list but I'm super happy to finally call it 'done'!",

      "This project is my 3D take on the album art from Zero 7's \"When It Falls\". The scene really comes together at Frame 50, where the original art lines up perfectly with my work. I used different tricks like converting the artwork into SVG and then turning those into 3D meshes to make this happen. \nTo give it a little extra something, I added some compositing effects like chromatic aberration and film grain. The original artwork is a piece from Blue Source Studios, but not much is known about them. With this piece, I've tried to keep the spirit of the original while putting my own spin on it. It's art meets music, in 3D.",

Each listen inspired a facet of the story I aimed to depict.\n ü§ñ The challenge and joy lay in bringing these auditory tales to life: surreal, contemplative, and wildly imaginative. Every element was meticulously modeled and animated in Blender, culminating in a final video piece seamlessly produced in DaVinci Resolve 17.",

While on set, I was captivated by this particular phone, which I then photographed and used as a reference to model and animate in Blender 3. The post-processing was done mostly in Blender and then finished in Davinci Resolve.\n Zahara, being a friend of mine, made this project even more meaningful. I'm extremely pleased with how it turned out and consider it one of my favorite concepts yet.\n I'm always open to new projects, especially those that allow me to blend my interests and skills in unique ways.
