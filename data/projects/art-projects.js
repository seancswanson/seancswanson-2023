There is just something about album art that leaves me wishing it was more than just a static image. So I gave this one the 3D treatment to bring it to life!\n\nüñºThe original album art depicted a tear with a collage by Gideon London revealed underneath. To translate this into 3D meant extracting each layer painstakingly with Photoshop. With each layer now a separate piece in a stack, the pieces will look subtly different/askew depending on the camera perspective because of the variation in distance away from the lens.\n\nAdd some ‚Äúdust‚Äù particles, a bit of movement, and a textured background that dynamically responds to light and üí• BOOM ~ art ~\n\nHow does your music inspire you? Stay well, lovely people of the internet.",

        "A 3D transformation of Zero 7's \"When It Falls\" album art. Frame 50 is the view that matches the album art and the camera smoothly and subtly pans around, tracking to an empty in the center. I used various techniques to achieve my vision such as recomposing the album art into an SVG and then transforming the paths to meshes. I used compositing effects to add some subtle flavor like chromatic aberration and film grain.\n\nAccording to discogs.com, Blue Source Studios designed the album art, but it's hard to find any information on the artist themself.",
